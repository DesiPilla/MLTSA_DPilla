# Machine Learning for Time Series Analysis
In my graduate studies at the University of Delaware, I enrolled in the course Machine Learning for Time Series Analysis
(PHYS 667). The instructor was Dr. Federica Bianco. I have personally
learned all concepts demonstrated in each assignment. The class repository can be found [here](https://github.com/fedhere/MLTSA_FBianco).

## Labs
The homework consisted of the following labs:
1. Fitting a linear model to GRB Afterglow Photometry
    * Normal equations
    * LinearRegression (from sklearn)
    * Minimizing an objective function (L1, L2, and Chi2)
2. Stock price analysis
    * Scatter and correlation matrices
    * Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots
    * ARMA and ARIMA model fitting
    * AIC minimization
3. Uber Ride Frequency
    * ARMA (Facebook Prophet)
        * Trends and seasonality
        * Regressors
        * Holidays
    * PyDLM
4. Points of Change in Earthquake Data
    * Single POC manually
    * POC with ```ruptures```
    * PyDLM
5. Feature Engineering PLAsTIcC challenge (Parts 1 & 2)
    * Preprocessing
    * TSNE Projections
    * AgglomerativeClustering & DBScan
    * Random Forests & Gradient Boosted Classifiers
