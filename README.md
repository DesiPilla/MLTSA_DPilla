# Machine Learning for Time Series Analysis
In my graduate studies at the University of Delaware, I enrolled in the course Machine Learning for Time Series Analysis
(PHYS 667). The instructor was Dr. Federica Bianco. I have personally
learned all concepts demonstrated in each assignment. The class repository can be found [here](https://github.com/fedhere/MLTSA).

## Labs
The homework consisted of the following labs:
1. Fitting a linear model to GRB Afterglow Photometry
    * Normal equations
    * LinearRegression (from sklearn)
    * Minimizing an objective function (L1, L2, and $$\chi^2)
